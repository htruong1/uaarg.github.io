      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition Day 3 has arrived and past. Yesterday we found out that we were team number 31 of 32 for flying. That meant that our flight time would be early in the morning. Big shout out to our base access liason, Brendan. He allowed us to store some equipment in his truck the day before, allowing us to keep our plane ready for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/compplane.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached the flight time and prepped our plane for launch. Our mission time started at 8:53am. Each member of the team had a specific role. Rijesh was the flight commander, Cindy was the imaging technician, Sebastian was the autopilot technician and Brian was the telemetry technician. Rijesh is also usually our safety pilot, but this competition does provide pilots. The safety pilot was fully debriefed beforehand on the workings of the UAV, autopilot controls, and failsafes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/working.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;mission_time&quot;&gt;Mission Time&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start of mission time we brought the plane into launch configuration in a little less than 3 minutes. This involved powering up the plane, establishing a telemetry link, establishing a Wi-Fi link, performing camera exposure and focus lock, installing the camera and engaging our image capture software. During this time Cindy and Sebastian set up the software portions of imaging and autopilot respectively. Rijesh was busy turning on the plane and configuring the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point the plane was ready for launch. Rijesh hand launched the plane and the safety pilot put the plane at 130m above the ground. Autonomous flight was engaged at this point. The plane did a 1/2 circle of a standby waypoint and proceeded to perform the autonomous waypoint navigation. This portion of the mission involves the plane flying to different waypoints autonomously. there are 6 different waypoints at varying altitudes. The autopilot performed this task admirably. Yea Autopilot lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next came the autonomous search area navigation. This task involves the plane autonomously performing a search pattern over a search area, while capturing images of the ground. The autopilot again excelled at this task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/flightplan.png' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flight Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/path.png' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flight Path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two tasks that were attempted were the Off axis target task and emergent target. The off axis target is looking for a target that is outside the operational area. This task was attempted by circling a waypoint near the edge of the operational area at increasing altitudes. We did not find this target. The emergent task involves being given a waypoint at the start of mission time and being able to have the plane autonomously navigate to this target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plane was then landed in autonomous mode and the 900 MHz link was turned off. In total ~23 minutes of mission time had elapsed out of our maximum of 40 minutes. Less than 30 minutes of mission time = Bonus Points!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;post_processing&quot;&gt;Post Processing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right before takeoff we lost our Wi-Fi communication link with the plane. This link is designed to transfer images to our ground imaging station for immeadiate processing. As a result all of our image processing had to be done after the plane had landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/commandtent.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images were then transferred onto ground station computers. Our ground imaging station software is not fully functional so a manual export had to be preformed. Rijesh and Cindy went through the photos reading out load the image number, and target description whenever they found a target. The next step was to manual insert the GPS data for each target. We found all 8 targets. Yay imaging lead!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/target.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/brian_on_trailer.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition is scored based on three different areas. A Journal Paper, a Flight Readiness Review and the Flight-Mission Demo. In total 55 teams had registered and had plans to display their unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Teams from around the world, including Turkey, Israel, India and Romania, participated. Of those 55 teams only 39 completed the Journal Papers. Of those 39 only 32 participated in the Flight-Mission Demo. UAARG placed 18th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Journal Paper is a technical paper detailing the design and testing of our UAS. Andrew, Rijesh and Cindy were the primary authors of this paper. In the feedback they let us know that they really liked the parts Andrew had written. They recommended more information on testing. We placed 23 of 39.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flight Readiness Review is a briefing that is used to show the judges that a team is ready and prepared to fly. Again they recommended that we provide more information on testing. We placed 28 of 34.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did we get 18? Well our Flight-Mission Demo went really well. This area is where teams actually give a demonstration of there system. Autopilot-wise the system performed admirably. The plane passed over each waypoint and was within 7m of the target waypoint alitude. Shout out to Sebastian for setting up our stellar flight plan. Our Imaging system ran throughout the flight and we were able to capture images of the entire search area. We placed 11th out of 32 teams in actual flight performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;future&quot;&gt;Future&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Autopilot we are looking into autonomous takeoff and landing. As well we are looking into incorporating better altitude control loops for wind conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Imaging we want to implement an external magnetometer away from current carrying wires to improve compass heading. We also want to do further tests on image capture and autopilot tagging lag. As well our Ground Imaging Station software needs to be improved so that it can be incorporated into our workflow. In reviewing the pictures we actually found the emergent target. Unfortunately we didn’t recognize it. Due to our software limitations we were not able to have both imaging operators look at all the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/emerge.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boo Imaging lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Communications we need to improve on establishing and maintaing Wi-Fi data links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall our performance was very well, especially if you consider the manpower and number of individuals who participated in autopilot and imaging. We’d like to thank everyone for making this such a success. This includes our faculty advisors Duncan Elliott and Michael Lipsett for all the time they spend with us. Peter Cary our safety pilot and airframe advisor. Cameron Lee for all his help in imaging, advising us on best practices, and staying with the club even after graduation. We would also like to thanks Joseph Patton for all his help in the airframe department and all his many other contributions. We would also like to thank the University of Alberta and Shell Canada for all of the support they have provided.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AUVSI SUAS Competition Day 2 - The Long Wait</title>
      <link>http://uaarg.com/2015/06/20/auvsi-competition-day-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://uaarg.com/2015/06/20/auvsi-competition-day-2</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/suas_pit_area.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another early morning and another long wait. Today we got up at 7 am, slightly later than yesterday. Breakfast would be served at the competition, so we mainly didn’t concentrate on eating breakfast in the hotel. We left and managed to arrive at the gate at 8:25 am and started to setup for our flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took only a few hours to set up and we waited to be called to the flight line. Initially the competition hosts had a list of 12 teams with flight slots; we weren’t on the list but there was a possibility that they would call us to the flight line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition had a queue of 5 teams on the flight line ready to fly at all times. The next few teams that would soon be called out to the flight line would be notified to prepare to head out; the teams would be chosen at random. If any of the teams called a time out, they would move to the back of the line of all the teams that had not flown. The next team after would then be up to fly. So because of this, each team on the flight line had to be ready to fly just in case the team before them decided to call a time out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/suas_flight_line.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we set up our plane to be ready to pack up and take to the flight line at a moment’s notice. As we waited around, we worked more on the competition flight plan and our ground station imaging software. Eventually the 12 team list dwindled down and other teams began getting notices that they would be soon taken out to the flight line. We continued to wait with the UAV assembled and equipment ready to be packed and loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually lunch came around and we got our lunches. Today it was either pulled pork or pulled chicken sandwiches with potato chips and a cookie. Then back to our waiting. Eventually we started to explore and talk with some of the sponsors and other teams. Google, MathWorks, Airware, Garmin, and many other sponsors had set up tents there. Each of us took our turns to explore the area and talk with sponsors about what they did and what cool new projects they were working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/2015_suas_pit_setup.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time continued to tick on and eventually it got to 5 pm; and there were still flights going on. We were somewhat hungry so we munched on some snakes we had bought on the first day from Walmart. The judges didn’t know if we would be called up. Once the list of 12 teams had been exhausted, teams would be called to the flight line randomly with sufficient notice, so until our time came, we would know when we were up. We discussed our options with Brendan, our Navy liaison, and continued to wait to make sure we were not called up for the day. Eventually we were called and told we were the second last team on the list. It was around 6pm and there were 5 teams on the flight line and around 4 team ahead of us who still had to go the flight line. It was unlikely that we would be called to the flight line. The flying had to stop before 8 pm and each team had 40 minutes of flight time. A little math said that there would still be quite a few teams ahead of us before flying ended. So we started to pack up for the day nice and slowly. Brandon offered to store some of the boxes that we weren’t using overnight for us, which was a great help since we wouldn’t have to pack as much into the van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then headed for dinner which, this time, was at The Noodle Company. The food was really good and fairly well priced. We each enjoyed our own noodle blow that we ordered. After we finished eating we returned to the hotel and did a bit more testing, blog writing and programming. Today however, we managed to go to bed at 11 pm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AUVSI SUAS Competition Day 1 Another Long Day</title>
      <link>http://uaarg.com/2015/06/18/auvsi-competition-day-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://uaarg.com/2015/06/18/auvsi-competition-day-1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second of our blog posts on the 2015 AUVSI Student UAS competition. “Hey, remember that long jet lag, the little to no sleep on the plane, and the going to bed at 1 am, well remember to get up early tomorrow,” is what was going thought our brains this morning as the team decided to wake up at 6 am. Breakfast was provided by the hotel so we all had decided we would eat at the hotel before we left. As it turns out, a few of us managed to eat breakfast, but the majority showed up only when the food had disappeared. So some decided to eat some of the sandwiches from the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/ontheroad.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With breakfast taken care of in a sense, we packed up and started to make our way to the air field. It was only a 20 minute drive to get there, so not too bad for travel time. On arrival to the gate, we meet up with our liaison, Brendon, who would escort us on and off the base every day that we were there. We also got our ID badges which we had to return at the end of the day and pick them up again the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a small drive down to a tarmac close to the runway where they had set up a long row of large tents with tables for each of the teams. There were 38 teams attending the competition this year, so lots of cars and lots of people. Our table was close to the parking lot so unloading was quite easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/tents.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/parking.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to our table and started to get ready for our safety inspection and flight readiness review briefing. Brandon made sure that we were settled and hung around to learn more about our UAV. The safety inspections were first come first serve, so we didn�t have to worry about time. Our flight redness review, which is a presentation of what our UAV has for system and how it will work, was scheduled for 2pm. It was 8am when we got to the filed so plenty of time. We did some troubleshooting, testing, and planning. During the time we are on base, we weren’t allowed to turn on any transmitters or WiFi routers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/setup1.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/setup2.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually lunch came around and we were all getting hungry. Lunch was provided by the competition and included a sandwich with potato chips. We ate our lunches meanwhile we continued to work on our UAV to make ready for inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/setup3.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eventually went to do our safety inspection after we made sure that all the codes were properly installed and everything was working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/inspection.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspection itself went relatively well, there were just a few hiccups, but nothing too major. One particular test was troublesome and we could not get to work. It was connecting to a server provided by the competition hosts, downloading, and uploading data during the flight. Of course we were just testing to make sure it worked but the issue was pretty simple, we could not connect to the server. It was only a secondary objective, so we did not have to complete this objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/inspection2.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/inspection3.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/inspection4.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition is split into 2 categories of objectives, primary and secondary. Primary objectives we must complete and included autonomous flight, search the area, and find targets on the ground. Secondary objectives were optional to complete and would add to your score. They included identify targets with the UAV still airborne by sending down images, capture an image of a target outside the flight boundary without flying outside the boundary, locate a target close to a set of coordinates given at take-off, sending flight information to a server on the ground provided by the competition hosts, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was the flight readiness review. The presentation itself was alright, nothing stellar by any accounts. There were quite a few improvements we could have made to the presentation and perhaps some more rehearsals would have made the presentation better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/latestay.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was still the issue with connecting with the server and when other teams left for their hotels, we stayed behind to troubleshoot our problems. We waited for the no transmitting restriction to be lifted before we could start troubleshooting. For around an extra hour or so we remained behind until the server was shut down for the day. We packed and left the field for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/inthevan.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around dinner time, so we drove down the road back to the hotel and looked for some place to eat. There was much debate on what kind of restaurant we should eat at, maybe even go back to the hotel and eat the rest of our sandwiches. Our first stop was Golden Corral but the buffet was too much food, so next a restaurant next door. Turns out it was a bar and not a restaurant. Then more debate. Eventually we stopped at Chipotle to get some burritos and bowls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/roomnight.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our way back to the hotel room and ate our food. We then started to with some more testing and troubleshooting for connecting to the competition server. We also completed the flight plan for the flight and some more programming for imaging. It was another late night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/roomnight2.JPG' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>AUVSI SUAS Competition Day 0 The Arrival</title>
      <link>http://uaarg.com/2015/06/17/auvsi-competition-day-0/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://uaarg.com/2015/06/17/auvsi-competition-day-0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first of our blog posts on the 2015 AUVSI Student UAS competition. Today was quite the day. We all got up early in the morning to catch our flights. We all decided to arrive 2 hours before our flight to the US and we just barely made the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/denver_airport.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First comes the check in, then comes bag security, then comes security, then comes customs at the United States border. So first we had to check in our bags at the airline check in, which wasn’t too bad, just a couple of hundred dollars and you were on your way. Next we brought our checked bags to security specifically for checked bags. We had two oversized crates that had both airframes and tools in them so we had to unpack everything. Security needed to see everything we packed and swab everything. It took some time but we still had plenty of time, so no worries. Next security for passengers. We spent a little bit of time meanwhile all the security personnel huddled together and made a telephone call to see if we could take the batteries with us on the plane. It all worked out and we meet all the regulations, so onto customs. We went through customs before we left Canada. It went pretty smoothly except one of us got held up for some more questioning. Apparently taking two large wooden creates on a plane through customs raises some questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we made the flight with 15 minutes to spare, which in retrospect wasn’t too bad with all the delays we got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, we got on the plane and flew to Denver, where our second fight was delayed. We spent some time in the airport exploring, eating food, and preparing for competition. Our next flight was to Baltimore Washington airport and was fairly uneventful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We landed, got our bags, took a bus to the rental car building, and got our not so much a grand caravan but something similar van. We filled it to the brim with all of our crates and bags, and drove straight to Lexington Park, Maryland… well straight enough. On our way to Lexington Park, we may have made a wrong turn and went on a detour that took an extra 15 minutes. But we got a lot of pictures on the scenic detour that we did take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/maryland_road_1.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/maryland_road_2.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/maryland_road_3.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/maryland_road_4.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to Lexington Park’s volunteer fire department hall at 8:00pm, where the check in for competition was. The competition was being held in Webster Field (of Naval Air Station Patuxent River), so the drive was only an hour and a half. We got all or information, singed some forms, meet up with our liaison for the military base, and were on our way to the grocery store because we needed food. It was past our dinner and we were all hungry, so what better place to get food then Walmart. It was sandwiches, potato chips, and orange juice for dinner tonight. We all still had some time, so we unpacked our suitcases, bags, and competition supplies in to hotel and started work on things for the next morning - presentations, competition objectives, camera and imagery, programming, and logistics. We were disallowed wireless transmission of any kind during the day tomorrow - as teams would be doing their safety inspections and radio frequency checks – so we did have to work out some logistics relating to wired connection of all our systems. All teams were only allowed to turn on their transmitters – radio control, telemetry, and payload Wi-fi alike – during the safety inspection and frequency check. We had to prepare for that short period of time to do a full check of our wireless systems while on site. Finally, we worked on our systems presentation, in which we had to present to a panel of judges our system setup, mission workflow, safety features, and existing system test data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lot to squeeze in with all the chaos of getting dinner, checking into the hotel, and unpacking; in the end, we all stayed up until 1 am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/packed_van.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Competition Day 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last flight didn’t go very well. We were fully prepared with our new airframe and were rearing to go the night before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We launched the plane into the air and had a successful ~40 second flight. After which the plane crashed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are unsure as to what the crashed as further investigation needs to be done. The plane was flying fine and in very close range. It started an uncontrollable roll and never recovered. One idea is that perhaps the flaperons weren’t fully turned off. If they were only turned off half way this would have resulted in limited recovery ability. Another possibility is 2.4 GHz interference. Two other teams crashed today due to interference on the 2.4 GHz spectrum, and a few others experienced interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/can_crashedplane.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was fairly relaxed, with competition photos and packing the plane. We did still submit a report though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/report.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening we attended the awards banquet. UAARG didn’t receive any prizes but the judges/competition organizers had many encouraging things to say and felt we performed well in different aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northrop Grumman was a big sponsor this year. They are fairly well known for Global Hawks, but make a wide variety of other systems, including their long range Triton system. The company representative there said there were three main things he was impressed with at competition. One of those things was UAARG’s modular design. He really liked our electronics boards. They have a very simple a laid out design. Each board is more or less identical allowing it to be swapped in and out readily. Components can also easily be swapped in and off the board. Yesterday’s fire was a fairly quick and easy fix due our voltage regulators being over rated for there task. As well our planes can swap parts, like wing and tail sections very easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I am fairly impressed with our performance at competition this year. We may not have done well, but our system is a lot more mature and as a team we were able to handle issues as they arose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/canteam.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew and Rijesh apparetnly didn’t get the memo that UAARG’s team shirts were safety vests.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Competition Day 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was fairly interesting. Day 2 of competition is the primary flight day. We are given 45 minutes to fly in the search area and another 60 minutes to compile a report of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our flight time was at 12:10pm, so the morning was filled with creating a final report template, readying the plane and a bit of programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set up our Ground Control Station(GCS) and were comfortably waiting. Finally our time came around. We started up the systems and were turning on imaging, when all of a sudden the plane caught fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier that day concern was expressed as to how strongly our voltage regulators were in place. As a result a rubber band was used to additionally secure them. The only damage was to a single voltage regulator powering our autopilot board. An electrical connection was quickly made so that the autopilot board drew power from the other voltage regulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/burn.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally with 17 minutes of flight time to spare we made it out to the field. Andrew had the plane up in the air and was just about to launch it when we got a no-go. Dirt-bikers had made there way into the airport property. We subsequently had to wait until they were chased off. Our time was paused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/dirtbiker.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew launched the plane, but something flew off as it left Andrew’s hand. Worried it was part of the prop or another vital component, Rijesh immediately cut throttle. The plane came down hard and the tail boom snapped again; in the same place as yesterday. Harmless logo stickers that were poorly applied to the plane had flown off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/stickers.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up not going into the air. We got our second airframe ready that afternoon and performed all necessary calibrations. We are feeling very confident about tomorrows flight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Competion Day 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day of competition. We got up very early this morning and headed out to the airport. Once there we finished unpacking the plane and started setting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/day2_1.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gave an oral presentation on our UAV and its capabilities. Andrew stood at the front of the room and presented to everyone. The main points that were highlighted were actionable inteligence from our live imaging link, modular design, and fast deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the Flight Readiness Review. This mostly deals with autopilot and ensuring all the failsafes are reliable. We passed the FRR succesfully and went on to test flights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose for the test flight was to trim our plane. Rijesh took the plane up, trimmed the plane, and tested autopilot. Unfortunately on landing the tail boom snapped. This has occured twice before at the same spot. We need to investigate means of reinforcing the tail boom to prevent this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/day2_2.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall we felt very confident with the aircraft’s performance and are excited for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon we repaired the tail, and the rest of the day we worked on our final report template, and flight plan for tomorrow’s flight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So yesterday was fun, filled with plenty of travel. The competition takes place in Alma, Quebec. Alma is a small town 3 hours north of Quebec City. To get there we flew from Edmonton to Toronto to Montreal. From Montreal we rented a minivan and drove to Alma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the night before packing the UAV, all peripheral components, spares and repair tools. For this competition we needed to take two flights. As a result we contructed wooden crates to hold the UAV in. The crates were canabalized from old competition crates, but never the less held strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 4:00am yesterday we left the club room and headed to the airport. We got through security just fine and had no issues with the LiPo batteries. We probably won’t be able to say the same for US competiton though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/airplanewing.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finally reached Montreal we caught a cab to the car rental service and headed out from there. The going was very slow in Montreal but the traffic eventually let up and we a had a long windy drive to Alma. Along the way, we worked on our competition presentation, discussed LOTR lore, worried about gas, tried speaking french, and speculated on what the traffic signs meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally reach Alma close to 11:00pm. We quickly unpacked and found everything unscathed. It was then time for a well deserved sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Developing Redundancy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi followers. Here’s another quick update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;launcher&quot;&gt;Launcher&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we are currently in the midst a developing a fully autonomous launching system. Ideally the pilot intervention should only be required during the landing stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;last_semester&quot;&gt;Last Semester&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Semester we had some major success on the autopilot front. We were able to achieve fully autonomous flight. The following are screenshots from google earth showing the path of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/auto2.png' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div class='full zoomable'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/auto3.png' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further tuning needs to be performed as well as incorporation of airspeed data. Stay Tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;redundancies&quot;&gt;Redundancies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently have one working plane. We are hoping to have three up and running planes. That involves modifying two more airframes, assembling two more electronics boards, loading up and configuring imaging computers, and pairing autopilot control boards with various modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of work ahead of us. The goal is to get a second plane ready by the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey world out there. We have been a bit slacking in updating our blog, hopefully that will change for this semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;highlights_from_last_semester&quot;&gt;Highlights from last semester:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Plane - If you recall shortly before US competition our plane had a fateful water landing. During the summer plans were set for our new plane. We have decided to continue using the EPP foam airframe that last year’s capstone group had developed. In the first two weeks of school Andrew, Cindy and Rijesh were busy busy putting the plane together. Andrew made all the modifications and assemebled the airframe, Cindy did her usual imaging magic, and Rijesh brought the electronics and autopilot all together. Our first flight was a success! (see below)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully Autonomous Flight - On our aircrafts maiden flight, we managed to get the plane to a fully autonomous state. The plane successfully navigated through three different waypoints on either side of the flying field, changing altitude by to 200m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kick-off Meeting - We held our annual kick off meeting. We had many people attend and the club room was quite packed last semester. We are hoping that will be the same for this semester as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the_coming_semester&quot;&gt;The Coming Semester&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have many projects planned for this semester. I’ll try to detail more of what we are doing in the coming weeks as well as the status of our system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Two crashes and rethinking the plane</title>
      <link>http://uaarg.com/2014/06/21/two-crashes-and-rethinking-plane/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello from the AUVSI Student UAS competition! The 4 of us – Joe, Paul, Cindy, and Rijesh – are currently in Lexington Park, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have heard, we had some show-stopping events just before the AUVSI competition. Inconceivable, our last remaining airframe, crashed twice into the North Saskatchewan River in the days just before the AUVSI Competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UVjnzF4vrpg/U6X44ycADJI/AAAAAAAAATg/qDnh90UarMU/s1600/WP_20140615_14_23_52_Pro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crash #1, with the boaters that rescued Inconceivable for us&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AlVd6IcR444/U6X44iVIIhI/AAAAAAAAATc/bFAuvgu1wdc/s1600/WP_20140616_20_29_50_Pro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crash #2, when we weren’t so lucky&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The causes of the crashes are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crash 1: Inconceivable has flaperons that were engaged on takeoff. These were not turned off after takeoff, meaning that the aileron servos could not move enough to have the plane bank as intended. The plane went into a severe right bank, lost altitude quickly, and crashed into the river. Thanks to the boaters in the picture above, we were able to recover the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crash 2: When tuning a pitch control loop in AUTO2, Inconceivable went into a severe pitch down and gained a significant amount of speed. The pilot was not able to recover Inconceivable in time. Because Inconceivable was pointing north at the time this happened, it descended into the river. These crashes were due to a combination of poor planning, a limited amount of time to tune and develop our autopilot, and pilot error. As a consequence, we have no functioning system right now, and are here at the competition as observers only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been starting to think about our next system. Because of the crashes, we are in need of a new airframe and a new camera system altogether. The EPP FPV airframe we previously had is out of stock, and we have been thinking about replacing our camera system for a while. Some ideas that have been floated for each of these include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small foam delta wing airframe. We’ve had good experiences with Murphy and Inconceivable, our two EPP FPV foam aircraft. Foam offers less weight and cheaper and easier repairs in case of a crash. We’ve seen 3 separate teams here with very similar delta wing models, and have been talking to them about their experiences.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Another scientific imaging camera (with a wider-angle lens that what we had).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A DSLR or other Canon/Nikon consumer camera running with a tethered shooting software, so that we can read live images from the camera.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A smartphone camera, with image processing happening on the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to the awards banquet tonight; there will be a post later today about some of the events of the competition, as well as the competition results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, Team Murphy flew. They were able to capture images and everything seemed well. Unfortunately midway through the flight their plane experienced a loss of R/C signal, and nose-dived into the ground from upwards of 50 meters. This was their last time to fly and the crash occurred during the early portion of the flight. As a result, they were not able to geo reference or visually spot any of the targets. Team Murphy was in high spirits despite this, and are raring to rebuild their system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y39Hr7bBqsY/U2dr72K-
rxI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/8uuwJAOztY4/s1600/WP_20140504_08_06_11_Pro.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y39Hr7bBqsY/U2dr72K-

&lt;p&gt;Team Murphy looking chipper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imaging portion of team UAARG had a late night last night. On the drive to Manitoba, we lost our single SD card containing our operating system running our imaging software. We had another, older backup; the imaging team stayed up to troubleshoot and try to get to a functional system. On the flight line, though, we had issues connecting to the onboard camera. Of the 40 minute time limit for our flying, we spent the first twenty trying to get good data from the camera again. Finally at the twenty minute mark we decided to just go with a quick RC flight. The RC flight performed far better than expected. The airframe and electronics were fairly untested and untrimmed but the plane handled with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we brought the plane back to the ground, the imaging systems still weren’t working. Our camera wasn’t having data being read from it at all. Rijesh came up with the idea to donate his phone as a camera for the flight; a minute and lots of tape later, we were ready to go up. We did a quick 2 minute flight of the search area with the phone precariously taped in, just in the nick of time for the mission to end. We were super excited to review the video once we got back to the pits; lo and behold, we caught three targets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k9uMkWZD9vM/U2dsCNKd

&lt;p&gt;After our flight, Arshad reconnected our camera and we were successfully able to run our imaging software and retrieve pictures encoded with geo-referencing data. Essentially, we managed to get all our systems fully functional and operational just as our mission timed out; our jerry-rigged system was that was put together just 2 days prior was functional and back to its original state! We pieced together our report with the data that we had captured, submitted it, and were done with the competition! We were all pretty thrilled and excited with our successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awards banquet was a pile of fun, as always, with a nod by the organizers to the U of A teams’ open, fun, and relaxed attitudes. (The precise term used to describe Team Murphy was “ballsy.”) Neither UAARG nor Team Murphy placed, but we were able to get some prize money. It’s not easy to get 100 people who are all interested in UAVs gathered in one room together, so we made the most of our time chatting with the organizers &amp;amp; judges &amp;amp; other teams and traded some contact information. The quality bar definitely seems to getting higher and higher each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been an exhilarating past couple of days. Let’s close this post here with an amazing shot of the Northern Lights that we were able to witness last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that Arshad or Usain Bolt? We can’t tell either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll talk to you soon!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With a pretty good night of sleep behind us, we trekked out to the pits. We were pretty burnt out the night before, but we had discovered a couple of problems: our wireless router was not turning on inside our hastily-reconstructed avionics box, and we had lost the SD card for the Pandaboard, taking all of our files with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a look at the wireless router in the morning, and soon found out that some of the voltage regulators we installed on the outside of the avionics box were burning hot. We soon found that our router was shorting up against our metal box, explaining our issues. We also had a fun scavenger hunt for the Pandaboard SD card, but this turned up nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first flight time came up a bit sooner than we expected. We had some trouble installing our avionics box inside the plane and so carved away a good 10 minutes of our 45-minute flight time. Once we were there, the first priority was to get an R/C flight in, since the system hadn’t left the ground since the crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we missed the same requirement this time that we did yesterday during our first Flight Readiness go-around: the throttle would not turn off if we lost the R/C link. As our flight time rolled on, we began to have more inexplicable issues: we had a weak R/C link, our telemetry link died, etc. Our time passed, and the plane hadn’t left the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were lucky enough to have Julien from VAMUdeS, who were running a TWOG and PPM encoder system set up for their autopilot (just like us) help us out with the last failsafe condition; once we had that and tested it, our plane was ready to go. We were ready, but the weather wasn’t: it started snowing outside, delaying our second flight to tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of stuff to work on once we got back: going out and buying parts, restoring a backup of the Pandaboard’s card, replacing our voltage regulators, debugging the imaging software, etc. Mostly, though, it was a lot of sitting around and waiting. Here’s some pics of that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Team Murphy side, they were out bright and early this morning - even more so than expected because of a crash from UVictoria beforehand. Because of a configuration mix-up, they weren’t able to get any pictures from their flight today. However, that was a quick fix, and the rest of their system was working perfectly well - lots of time to kill. Several hours of tomfoolery later, they made this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flight path of Team Murphy’s plane and locations of images they took&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is data of the test flight they did yesterday. The yellow pins are the locations of the images taken during the flight, and the red path is the flight of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, both teams are in really good spirits. Team Murphy has their system entirely functional, Team UAARG is finally ready to fly. In addition to this, we got to travel around a lot to the other teams’ pits to learn more about their systems and share our woes. Interestingly, there seems to be very heavy sponsorship of a lot of teams this year, with loads of donated commercial hardware and imaging software making its way into teams’ systems. No matter what the system, though, everyone had issues with the wind or their RF links or their failsafes - it ended up being only 4 of 11 teams that actually flew today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight’s our free evening for hanging out. We’re going to hang out, rest up, and get ready for the last day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of our competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iE2mzHSlMyQ/
U2REy5M4eeI/AAAAAAAAAO0/X5iTxdGpL2s/s1600/WP_20140502_17_15_29_Pro.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iE2mzHSlMyQ/U2REy5M4eeI/AAAAAAAAAO0/X5iTxdGpL2
s/s1600/WP_20140502_17_15_29_Pro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived safely last night/this morning at 1:00am. The ride was filled with coding, learning and all-around competition preparation. As per our previous blog post, you may be aware that we had a few issues with our airframe, specifically the part when we decided to take it for a dip. Some quick executive decisions were made to purchase replacement parts and our entire lab was brought along with us to Manitoba. So at 1:00am there we were setting up our lab in one of the rooms. Exhibit A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6nOR6KMOSAE/U2RDirwJv8I/AAAAAAAAAOk/Nr-
DB32a9Ww/s1600/WP_20140502_03_02_39_Pro.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6nOR6KMOSAE/U2RDirwJv8I/AAAAAAAAAOk/Nr-
DB32a9Ww/s1600/WP_20140502_03_02_39_Pro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Busy away. Slowly one by one we fell and gave in to sleep. The majority of Team UAARG getting less than an hour of sleep. Going to bed a 6:00 and waking up at 7:00. Later this morning, the one time you can say that, we got up and presented our project proposal. At this competition, we are “contracted” to perform aerial surveillance, georeference targets, and calculate areas. We each spoke a bit about our respective fields with Cindy giving a general idea of why they should choose us as opposed to our competition. Following that we finished our final rewiring. At this point we were in a state where we could successfully capture images and tag them with telemetry data. The competition has a Flight Readiness Review(FRR). Basically a test we have to pass that ensures we have proper safety features present. At this point we should theoretically have passed the FRR but would have done so in a very round about way. Instead we decided to perform additional modifications to take the system to the very same level as the pre-crash plane. And that is just what we did. The first time the judges came to see our test we asked them to give us an extension, which they graciously gave. The second time the judges came by we thought we had everything configured correctly, but missed a requirement. Finally a third time we went out and passed the test with flying colours. Just on the nick of time as well. We performed a quick range test and noticed we were not receiving the same poor reception. It seems like our crash was caused by the metal cowl we had installed on the previous plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all though of the 11 teams only 2 teams actually flew today. UAARG did not manage to take our plane up for a test flight, but we were capable to do so. Alas we readied our plane 15 minutes too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From two days ago we had a drenched box full of electronics and now we have rebuilt the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NcD-JsZlPNQ/

&lt;p&gt;“The big job was coming together as team, and you guys did that” – Joseph Patton&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two teams that actually flew today, one was Team Murphy. Their flight was welcomed with applause. It was very heavy winds and basic flight control was very difficult. Thankfully they made it down in one piece. Murphy retrieved some very good images from this flight and look very prepared for the official competition. They also received two standing ovations for Rijesh’s piloting, mostly because there were no seats. But still a standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Canadian Competition After a Lovely Little Dip</title>
      <link>http://uaarg.com/2014/05/01/canadian-competition-after-lovely/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So after a very lengthy period of not posting, it is time for Canadian Competition again. Right now we are on our way to Southport, Manitoba, rocking to skipping music tracks and testing electrical components. So why are we testing components, well yesterday we decided to let the plane take a dip at the pond adjacent to our flying field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tQGKtS5-m6g/U2LnVe-p7pI/AAAAAAAAAOU/PRyzpM6u7xg/s1
600/lRpg0GdnpHArknGAKjeGTiGtdKk7QWgO2wwusmnrIWA.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tQGKtS5-m6g/U2LnVe-p7pI/AAAAAAAAAOU/PRyzpM6u7x
g/s1600/lRpg0GdnpHArknGAKjeGTiGtdKk7QWgO2wwusmnrIWA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rijesh and Mark pulling the plane out of the pond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fun adventure pulling this fellow out of the lake. We were experiencing intermittent Radio Control(RC) loss while in the air. Some on ground range testing would have been wise, but fortune favours the bold. Apparently not. The plane lost RC and crashed into the lake. Our Airframe is in fairly decent shape. The landing gear is a goner but the plane took the crash well. Our Avionics box filled with itself up with water. We have two switching voltage regulators that were built as a capstone project, and thankfully those shorted and blew up fairly quickly. Our telemetry radio has a few scorch marks on it, so it is probably pushing up daisies. Apart from that the rest of the electronics seem fine. Contrary to popular belief water isn’t that extensively damaging to circuitry. As long as the water is not filled with excessive dissolved solvents the water actually acts as an insulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Mark’s steadfast work, we have a second airframe ready to go. We should be able to remake the Avionics box, with a few adjustments to accommodate a new radio and possibly and new autopilot board. Our current Autopilot board uses something called a PPM encoder which takes the signals from all the channels of the RC receiver and converts it into a single pulse signal. If this is fried we may or may not decide to transition to a Lisa/M 2 autopilot board. This board has a built in receiver. Using this board will require us to reconfigure our autopilot software. Since we are not using any autopilot stabilized flight, this would not actually benefit us. At this competition, however, we were only planning on flying the plane via RC. The original autopilot board without the ppm encoder will still allow us to fly, take photos, geo-reference images, and monitor the plane’s telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back it seems like our intermittent RC issues may have been due to a metal cowl we added to the plane. We have eliminated faulty hardware and brown outs as possible causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, we are bringing a second team to the competition – Team Murphy. They’re a subgroup of UAARG composed of fourth year students designing a small lightweight UAV for their capstone project. All fourth year engineering students take part in a yearlong project, where they apply what they have learned from a variety of their courses. They had some very promising results in there test flight yesterday. They managed to retrieve very clear images and find some targets we set up on the ground, giving some good data for the georeferencing part of their system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The van was just now filled with everyone on a laptop coding and working away on something or another, save the driver.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AUVSI SUAS Competition part 2</title>
      <link>http://uaarg.com/2013/06/22/auvsi-suas-competition-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://uaarg.com/2013/06/22/auvsi-suas-competition-part-2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been an eventful, stressful, and exciting few days for us at the AUVSI SUAS competition; we’ve finally finished with all things competition and are totally ready to get some much-needed sleep. We placed 23rd overall out of a total of 33 teams at the competition. We received a $400 cash prize, and our oral presentation scored fairly high at a position of 15th, beating the first place team who got 18th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day one of the competition was mostly getting setup and tested to be certified to fly. As we started the day, we were dedicated mostly to our last minute preparations to our Flight Readiness Review. The FRR was the oral presentation component of the competition; we were required to go over an overview of our system, our safety measures, and the results of our systems testing. In the end, we were able to prepare a nice, organized 15 minute presentation that closely followed the requirements for the review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another crucial task on day one was the setup of the autopilot system; this included setting up the failsafes and defining the search areas and boundaries of the field. One component of the competition was navigating the plane through a series of waypoints, and so these also had to be plotted. As we did not feel comfortable flying in fully autonomous mode, our plan was to have Cameron (our safety pilot) navigate using stabilized flight mode through these waypoints, then fly a pattern over the search area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day two was when flights started. We arrived early in the morning to set up our system and make small improvements. T here were, of course, various issues that popped up throughout the day. Under the heat, the epoxy glue holding the elevators melted, and we had to quickly remove and repair the elevators. We also worked on creating a better image geolocation algorithm; throughout the day, we were in a rush to finish things because we weren’t certain how long the other teams would take for their flights and when we would be up for ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 5:00 PM on day two after around 23 teams had flown, they announced that the remaining teams would fly the next day and that we were in the first four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally received our chance to go out and fly on Saturday. Each team was given one chance to complete a mission flight time of 40 minutes. As soon as we arrived at the field we set up our system for our flight. Somewhere within the frantic activities of assembling the plane and taking it out to the flight area, the XTend transmitter lost it’s ability to transmit past 10 meters. We made our way out onto the air strip, setup the ground and imaging stations, the mission time started, and we commenced our pre-flight checks, only to discover the fault in the XTend radio. 17 minutes and 33 seconds into the mission time, Cameron requested a timeout, which was granted. Arshad, Sheldon, and Cameron took off to the nearby St Mary’s College campus to see what was wrong with the radio without interfering with other team’s radio transmissions. After much troubleshooting and testing, the problem was diagnosed: the RF cable connector between the Xtend radio and the antenna was causing attenuation, so was swapped out with a new XTend module which has an RP-SMA connector to allow a direct antenna, foregoing the problem-ridden cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/c6qbwdu5iiFHaBlquTs4D0np4MUH2bPimM

C0z8jg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The XTend radio we’ve been using reliably for many months&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a remaining mission time of 22 minutes, we hustled out into the field for our second flight. We soon got the entire system up and running: telemetry, R/C, and Wi-Fi links were all functional at the beginning of the flight, and images were being successfully transferred and displayed. However, immediately upon taking off we noticed that the elevator neutral was much too far down. This was because we had to replace it the previous day since the epoxy holding the elevators together softened up in the heat and we obviously mis-estimated the proper neutral. After landing and adjusting the servo positions, we took off to make the most of our remaining 12 minutes of flight time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this flight, we noticed that images were coming in at a very sporadic rate, and that only a limited number of images were being transferred. Most of these images were of locations near the runway, and none of them contained a target. The Wi-Fi connection from the onboard Pandaboard to the ground imaging computer was spotty all throughout the flight, which caused certain photos to fail to transfer. After our landing, we tried to transfer the images directly from the Pandaboard to our ground station, but there was too little time to do so and to obtain the target information for the judges; in the end, we handed in a blank target sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our flight path including elevation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the problems with the flight and the different parts of the plane, we still got some amazing data: alot of the search area was covered by Cameron’s impeccable piloting, and a lot of the targets were captured by the plane. GPS and altitude of the plane were recorded beautifully by paparazzi, and we were able to export the data to google earth, where we were treated with a 3D model of the planes path around the flight area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still need to take a closer look at our GPS data to see how accurately we might have located these targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, although we didn’t perform as well as we wanted to at this competition we believe that we’ve made significant progress this year and are looking forward to further development over the summer and through 2013-2014 for next year’s competitions. We’ll continue to work on stuff, seek new members, and update this blog as we rise to meet the many more challenges that are sure to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AUVSI SUAS Competition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And here we go again… competition #2: the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) competition. This competition is in Maryland in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning from our trip to Quebec, we arrived at the airport 4 hours early this time. Because of this, and because the airport was practically empty - only overnight flights were left - baggage check in went smoothly. Our crates were 68 and 70 pounds with the limit being 70. Some of our checked luggage was 48 and 49 pounds, with the limit (to avoid a fee) being 50. We had to show Air Canada their own rules on maximum luggage size though. Before we did this, they were telling us the maximum sizes to avoid the oversize fee as if those were the absolute limits. They were very friendly and helpful though, especially considering our complex situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re currently waiting for our flight which should leave at 1:00 am. Hopefully we’ll get sleep in the air since by the time we get to Washington, it’ll be 10:00 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cindy and Arshad waiting at the airport&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for technical aspects, we’ve been working hard on our system for the past month and a half. We did lots of flight testing, but damaged the plane twice and spent a lot of time trying to get neutral IMU values. We’ve fixed our plane and have relatively reliable stabilized flight, but haven’t achieved fully autonomous flight yet. As for imaging, we’ve made a lot of progress. Images are now reliably transferred over FTP and the ground imaging GUI can load them up as they come in. We still need to work on our geo-referencing algorithm. Pictures taken during flight testing showed that this can be off by over 50 meters. We’ll be working on this over the next day or two as well as enabling telemetry over Wi-Fi so that we can show off our redundant link software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Competition Flight 2 - Day 3 - USC UAV Competition</title>
      <link>http://uaarg.com/2013/05/06/day-3-usc-uav/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, we were able to get out onto the field right away and perform a range test. Soon afterwards, we began our second competition flight. We brought a second router for this flight in order to set up a connection to a computer that would display the GCS to the pilot, in an attempt to perform stabilized flight out of the line of sight and thereby expand our search area. The plane’s takeoff and flight were smooth, and the radio and telemetry links to the plane remained connected throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_PQtLWAmY2I/UYgt7AMx4II/AAAAAA
AAAGw/VAmeaHt4Idk/s1600/blogp1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_PQtLWAmY2I/UYgt7AMx4II/AAAAAAAAAGw/VAmeaHt4Id

QB_V31E4/s1600/blogp2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, almost immediately after takeoff, we noticed that the wi-fi connection between the Pandaboard and the ground imaging laptop was extremely weak, and at one point, even disconnected entirely. This meant that we were only able to wirelessly transfer the first few photos taken by the plane. We continued with the flight because it was still possible to land and make a direct wired connection afterwards to transfer the images taken. A few of us hypothesized that there was some interference between the two routers, but it was only after the plane landed that we discovered that the new router was using the _ exact same frequency _ as the router used for the imaging despite being set to auto select an unused frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wAaa9RlDcpU/UYguaxwgDdI/AAAAAA
AAAG8/cs8iBFYoD1g/s1600/blogp2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wAaa9RlDcpU/UYguaxwgDdI/AAAAAAAAAG8/cs8iBFYoD1

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the targets at the imaging station&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, we were still able to get all the images that the plane took. Here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U7TwmsXP0tQ/UYgswg9kk0I/AAAAAA
AAAGo/OjvLR9HUsS4/s1600/blogp3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U7TwmsXP0tQ/UYgswg9kk0I/AAAAAAAAAGo/OjvLR9HUsS
4/s1600/blogp3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZrN4_wKeMJ4/UYgu14BCDVI/AAAAAA
AAAHE/sUdWJaMTp3U/s1600/blogp4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZrN4_wKeMJ4/UYgu14BCDVI/AAAAAAAAAHE/sUdWJaMTp3
U/s1600/blogp4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there was no possibility of discerning targets from any of these blurry photos. This was because we had made another critical mistake: we had taken out the working camera used for yesterday’s flight and replaced it with the other identical but unfocused camera. Therefore, during this flight, we were unable to identify any targets. With the wind picking up and dark clouds approaching, competition flights ended during the morning, and with that went our last chance to improve on yesterday’s score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon’s activities were a welcome break. Most of this time was taken up by the Mini-expo, which was a chance for all of the teams to set up their systems to show to the public, sponsors, and other competitors, and to go around and talk to the other teams. Cameron tried to add telemetry over Wi-Fi functionality to the Panda Board in order to show a proper demo of his redundant link system, but there were problems setting it up. Nevertheless, we were able to gather some interesting information about the other teams’ operations. We also got a chance to look inside the unmanned aircraft MISKAM at its systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After packing up our aircraft and other supplies, we headed to the final banquet for acknowledgments, congratulations, and finally the announcement of results. All of the teams that were able to get airborne were also able to get target information. It turned out for us that out of the three targets we identified the previous day, only two were correctly georeferenced. Every other team obtained more targets than we did, mainly by virtue of performing more than one flight with collection of target data. It seemed that correctly obtaining GPS coordinates was a problem for many teams; even the top team, VAMUDeS, had incorrect GPS information for about a third of their 30 targets. We were glad to still receive a $500 cash prize; we also obtained files with the correct target information and locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One bonus during this trip was our reception of media coverage. A reporter from Radio-Canada came to the airport yesterday to do a news story on the competition, and she interviewed- us about our systems and out performance during our first flight. Our team ended up receiving the majority of the coverage of the news story; a link to it can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www
.radio-canada.ca/regions/saguenay-lac/2013/05/04/004-drone-competition-

&lt;p&gt;Demonstrating our ground control station to the RDI reporters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alma was an incredibly hospitable place, and we had a lot of fun during the competition despite encountering some pretty major obstacles. There are many things for us to reflect on for the next competition, and an enormous list of things for us to work on, including a better systems presentation, major fixes for the ground imaging software, and more detailed pre-flight checklists. This Thursday, we will be having a meeting at which we can work on these and plan the next one and a half months until the AUVSI competition. Stay tuned for more updates then.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After all of the troubles yesterday, today has been a breath of fresh air so far. We got up at 6:30 AM for breakfast at 7:00 AM and start of round 1 flights at 8:00 AM. Of the ten teams, we’re last on the list to fly, so we flew at around 1:00 pm. With the servos now adjusted properly (thanks to a member from team VAMUdeS for helping with this), we had a great manual takeoff, very stable flight, and even flew in auto1 (stabilized) flight for extended periods of time. We were also able to take pictures and start looking for targets. During our 30 minute flight block, we actually took off and landed twice. During the first flight we lost our telemetry link to the autopilot during takeoff, but it worked great during the second flight, so we’re not sure what went wrong. Also, we lost connection to the on-board computer while in the air, but re-acquired it after the plane came closer to the ground station. We were able to view and look for targets, although our ground imaging software wasn’t loading the new pictures properly, so we did this manually using an image viewer. After our 30 minute flight period, we had issues with the FTP transfer so copied the remaining images over via USB. We then filled out our target sheet with the three targets we found and submitted it to the judges (pictures of these targets to be added after the competition is over).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cindy Xiao looking for targets during the flight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A portion of our flight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we consider this flight a success and are working hard to make our next one even better. There are three things we’re working on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the FTP connection working reliable. As of this blog post, we actually think we’ve got this finished.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Set up a second autopilot GCS for the pilot to view the plane on a map while flying in stabilized mode. This should let us fly further away from the takeoff area to cover a larger search area. As of this post, the setup has been done, but the decision as to whether we’ll actually fly further away will be made during out phase 2 flight tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fix the ground imaging station software so that we can load and view pictures. Or, if this proves too difficult, create a new, simple program that will convert the UTM location data into lat and long data automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been informed that the rest of phase 2 will start tomorrow, so that’s when we’ll be flying next. this gives us the opportunity to fix our issues and get a good night of sleep. As long as we don’t encounter any unexpected issues, tomorrow should be a great day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setup and Flight Testing - Day 1 - USC UAV Competition</title>
      <link>http://uaarg.com/2013/05/03/usc-uav/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The morning today was mostly dedicated to assembly and preparation of systems, our safety briefing, and our systems presentation. The preparation for the presentation was done in a rush, and we did not go over the technical details of our systems and our team’s project management as much as we would have liked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran into a host of unexpected issues almost as soon as we finished assembling our plane and avionics box; as a result, it took a good part of the day to successfully receive and transmit data from the plane and demonstrate our failsafes in order to pass our flight readiness reviews and be cleared for flight tests. First, when we went to do our flight readiness review, none of our kill switches worked – because the lack of GPS was already killing the plane, but we didn’t realize this until later. Then there was a bad connection in the IMU followed by a mysterious issue with one of the power supplies within the plane cutting out. We don’t know yet whether this was a short or some other cause, because when we disassembled the avionics box to replace the power supply, it started working again and has been fine since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we got to the field, we were able to perform a calibration of our IMU, a demonstration of our failsafes, and a successful manual flight with transmission of telemetry data. The flight, however, was not smooth; the plane’s ascent was choppy, and the pilot (Cameron was barely able to control it). After three failed landing attempts – one where the plane nearly exited the flight area while at only 10 m, we eventually landed the plane with no damage. We determined that the cause of this brutal flight was twofold: the deflection of the elevator and aileron control surfaces was much too too high (the deflections in these reached their maximums at only 50% input), and the COG was a little bit tail-heavy. We were easily able to fix both of these issues and should be able to fly properly tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on imaging systems has also been encountering numerous issues, including problems with wi-fi connection of the imaging computer to the PandaBoard, offsets returned by ground imaging target selection algorithm too large to be reasonable, and issues with loading images and data from watched directories. As we now have basic flight functionality, we plan to focus most of our work tomorrow on imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 0 - Unmanned Systems Canada UAV Competition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good news - we have just arrived in Alma, Quebec for the Unmanned Systems Canada Student UAV Competition. The past few days leading up to competition have been both hectic and tiring as we struggled to get systems in good working order, to pack our plane and tools, and to rest up to be in good traveling shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NZW6qhOeaO8/UYM
88eLJvbI/AAAAAAAAAE8/lNWhMSbYyd4/s1600/IMG_20130501_162451_1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NZW6qhOeaO8/UYM88eLJvbI/AAAAAAAAAE8/lNWhMSbYyd
4/s1600/IMG_20130501_162451_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plane disassembled and packed in its crate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met at the airport this morning at 4:30am and promptly discovered that one and a half hours was not enough to make it to the gate at a comfortable time for our 6am flight. Re-packing our spare items into checked baggage and processing our two large oversized crates were both extremely time-consuming, and we just made it in time for boarding. Fortunately, the remainder of our trip by air to Montreal went well, and we were able to drop off our crates to be shipped and promptly get our rental car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CNrB7PTju2E/UYM9M

ybIt3YYo/s1600/IMG_20130502_144429.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_mLDx3TsYJE/UYM9TNgca-I/AAAAAAAAAFM/tV-
ybIt3YYo/s1600/IMG_20130502_144429.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our crates, finally arrived at Montreal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major things that we got done during the trip was creating a complete flight plan specific to the airfield in Alma. This included defining the perimeter of the competition field in our autopilot software, determining the flight altitude, and creating takeoff and landing waypoints. We also worked on refining the ground station imaging system and on our Technical Presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, we perform both our Technical Presentation and Flight Readiness Reviews, both major contributors to our overall score. These are critical for giving judges an overview of our systems and for ensuring flight safety prior to the first day of competition flight on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Redundant Communication - An Improvement to Paparazzi</title>
      <link>http://uaarg.com/2013/04/21/redundant-communication-improvement-to/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://uaarg.com/2013/04/21/redundant-communication-improvement-to</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a special post, written to describe the redundant communication project being worked on by myself - Cameron Lee - current president of UAARG. The goal of this project is to allow multiple radio modems or other links be used between the aircraft and the ground station in a redundant fashion so that even if one link is lost, communication can be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the plane to ground component has been created and tested. This post describes how to use it and how it works. The code can be viewed or downloaded from github:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uaarg/paparazzi/tree/redundant_comms&quot;&gt;https://github.com/uaarg/paparazzi/tree/redundant_comms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following video is a demonstration of the system working and the interface that lets you monitor links. The sections below discuss the details more thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redundant Link Demonstration for Papparazzi Autopilot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll assume that the reader is somewhat familiar with how the ground segment of Paparazzi currently works. However, this information can be found on the wiki, here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://paparazzi.enac.fr/wiki/Overview#System_Architecture&quot;&gt;http://paparazzi.enac.fr/wiki/Overview#System_Architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a block diagram showing how the plane talks to the various ground segment programs (also known as agents):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8-YENO6LcN
s/UXMRpkJlx1I/AAAAAAAAEZQ/Z3XDrJCRzQs/s1600/Normal+Communication+Layout.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8-YENO6LcNs/UXMRpkJlx1I/AAAAAAAAEZQ/Z3XDrJCRzQ
s/s400/Normal+Communication+Layout.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paparazzi Ground Segment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ivy bus lets the programs talk to each other through the use of short messages. The direction of the coloured arrows is key since it shows the main flow of these messages. Next we have a block diagram of the redundant link system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nx_p90B7FU4/UXMddbJ_gEI/AAAAAAAAEZg/qnbrS-
bS3l0/s1600/Redundant+Communication+Layout.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nx_p90B7FU4/UXMddbJ_gEI/AAAAAAAAEZg/qnbrS-
bS3l0/s640/Redundant+Communication+Layout.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paparazzi Ground Segment with Redundant Links&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we can see a new agent, the Link Combiner. We also see multiple occurrences of the Link agent. When operating in redundant mode, each occurrence of Link transmits the data it receives from the plane to the Link Combiner instead of the Server. It does this by transmitting the received telemetry messages within the TELEMETRY_MESSAGE message which the Server doesn’t listen to. The Link Combiner on the other hand does. TELEMETRY_MESSAGE messages are sent by each link and include the id of that link. The Link Combiner listens to all of them and then transmits a single set of messages to the Server with the combined data. This results in the Server and all other ground segment agents (such as Messages and the Real Time Plotter) getting their telemetry data from Link Combiner as if it was coming from a single occurrence of Link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how_to_use&quot;&gt;How to Use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement redundant links using this code, there are three simple steps to follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect the hardware - on the airborne side, connect the Tx of the autopilot to multiple radio modems. On the ground side, connect multiple modems as normal (using USB to serial adapters, or whatever).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Launch a Link agent for each modem. Use two new command line arguments: _ -redlink _ and _ -id. _ The _ -redlink _ flag tells Link that it’s one of multiple links. The _ -id _ flag lets you specify an integer number as the id of that particular link.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Launch the Link Combiner agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following screenshot shows a setup with two links, connected to serial ports ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1, and with id’s 1 and 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4ytdpqXMHa0/UXMlR-

&lt;p&gt;The Agents Running in a Redundant Link Setup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interface&quot;&gt;Interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the redundant link system is started (even if only one Link is used), several changes appear in the GCS. This is achieved by the new message LINK_STATUS which is sent by the Link Combiner. These new features are designed to allow closer monitoring and better management of the link(s) between the aircraft and the ground station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following screenshot clearly shows these changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jI
7EMZ_0614/UXMjlc1MoBI/AAAAAAAAEZo/LwOgVQN336o/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-04-15

o/s640/Screenshot+from+2013-04-15+22_59_01.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we can see that there is a new page in the notebook named Link. This page contains critical information for each link. More information can easily be added, but for now, it shows the status of the link (just like the main Link status indicator in the strip), the current ping time, and the rate of received messages. So if one link is lost, it’s status indicator will turn red and start counting up just like link 2 in the above screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we can see that the main Link status indicator that’s located in the strip has been modified slightly. It now shows the ratio of connected links to the total number of links. I.e. 3/4 means that there are four links and one of them has been lost. Furthermore, the indicator will be green if all links are connected, yellow if one or more are lost, and red if all links are lost. Once all links are lost, the indicator will count up just like before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, alerts have been added to the console. Whenever a link is lost or reconnected, a message will appear in the console stating so. Messages also appear when a new link is added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;link_combiner&quot;&gt;Link Combiner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Link Combiner agent is written in Python. It receives messages from all of the Links (when they’re in redundant mode), and outputs messages to the Server and other ground segment agents. There is a bit involved however since the Server and GCS shouldn’t be sent identical messages. I.e. if the plane sends a message and it’s received successfully by more than one link, then that particular message should only sent by Link Combiner once. This is a somewhat tricky requirement since there is no guarantee that the message will be received by all of the links, and it’s possible that the plane actually sends a second message that’s exactly the same as the first. No extra info (such as a time-stamp or counter) is added to the messages sent from the plane to the ground, so the Link Combiner employs an algorithm to detect duplicate messages. Testing has shown that for typical links, this algorithm performs extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm gives each link a circular buffer to store the last N messages. When a new message comes in on a particular link, the algorithm first checks if it’s already in that link’s buffer. If it is, then it’s obviously a new message, so its removed from all of the other buffers if it’s in any of them. Then, the message is sent. If the message isn’t already in the link’s buffer, then it’s added to the buffer. After that, all of the other link’s buffers are checked for the message. If it’s in any of them, then the message was already received by another link, so isn’t sent. If it’s not in any of them, then the message is sent. The following flowchart depicts this algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G1LYSsliAiY/UXNBjHj9
3PI/AAAAAAAAEaI/hom9cRmd3jI/s1600/Algorithm+Diagram.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G1LYSsliAiY/UXNBjHj93PI/AAAAAAAAEaI/hom9cRmd3j
I/s640/Algorithm+Diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algorithm to prevent duplicate messages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the plane sends various, possibly identical, messages and the links gain and lose connection, there is no guarantee that this algorithm will do a perfect job of filtering out identical and only identical messages. Howeve r, in typical operation, it seems to work very well. And for the application of displaying aircraft data, the occasional missing or duplicate message is acceptable. There are only a few scenarios where the Link Combiner won’t produce perfect results, and they should come up infrequently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A message will be sent twice if the buffer size is too small to hold all of the messages received from one link between that link receiving the message and another link receiving the identical message. When the second link receives the message that has already been received, if the original isn’t in the buffer anymore, than the algorithm won’t know it’s a duplicate message. This scenario should be considered whenever implementing a redundant link system. Partly because it is the most likely to come up, but also because if it does occur, then all messages will be duplicated. In order to avoid this scenario, you can set the buffer size as a command line argument of Link Combiner. To know what a good value would be, you can observer the Ping time and Rx messages/s of the links in the new Link page of the notebook. Calculate the minimum buffer size by taking the difference between the largest ping time and the smallest ping time and multiplying it by the largest Rx messages/s. Then apply a safety factor when setting the buffer size - 10 times the calculated value should be good.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A message won’t be sent when it should be if the autopilot sends a message that’s the same as one it already sent (same name and exact same values) AND at least one link was lost between the first message and the second AND the link that’s receiving the second message doesn’t have the first message in it’s buffer still. That’s three conditions. If this happens, then the Link Combiner will see the second message as a duplicate of the first and will skip it. Only this one message will be missed though - it won’t start happening to all messages. Also, the data will have been data that was already received. So if it’s for example the battery voltage message, then it’s not a big deal to miss it. As long as there aren’t links rapidly being lost and gained, then this shouldn’t happen often. Note that as the buffer size is increased, I believe that this becomes more likely to happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. As you can see, this is just the first half to a completely redundant communication system. Once the autopilot is programmed to allow multiple datalink inputs, then a fully redundant, two-directional communications system can be used with Paparazzi. Furthermore, additional features could be added such as the ability to send different messages over different links, or messages at different rates over different links. This could all be configured in the Link page of the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to contact me regarding this at cam.w.lee@gmail.com or through the paparazzi-devel@nongnu.org mailing list (include my name somewhere in the e-mail so that it makes it past my filter).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flying in the Snow</title>
      <link>http://uaarg.com/2013/04/20/flying-in-snow/</link>

      <guid>http://uaarg.com/2013/04/20/flying-in-snow</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been quite a while since our last post. Many of you can probably guess why… exams. As this semester comes to an end, we’re all extremely busy with studying. Nevertheless, our competitions are approaching fast, so we’re continuing work on our UAV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2LL-
VYAcTPk/UXI2-t50P_I/AAAAAAAAAEs/8QTaoLCUIOE/s1600/HPIM5304.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2LL-
VYAcTPk/UXI2-t50P_I/AAAAAAAAAEs/8QTaoLCUIOE/s1600/HPIM5304.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusting the Skis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went flying this Wednesday to test our autopilot. Our objective was to perform a few manual flights to record the necessary data to start configuring the autopilot for our Senior Telemaster Plus. Then, if everything went according to plan, we would attempt stabilized (auto1) flight. Of course, everything didn’t go according to plane. Because we had so many issues, here they are itemized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the picnic tables were buried in snow, so we had to use one located right next to a pool of water.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The autopilot couldn’t receive a location from our new GPS. In fact, it didn’t receive any data at all. We figured this was a wiring issue, so just connected the old GPS.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When trying to use X-CTU to set the power level of the ground XTend radio, we couldn’t connect. We eventually solved this by turning off the plane’s XTend - it was transmitting to the ground XTend and blocking our attempts.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When attempting our first take-off, the snow presented enough resistance to keep the plane on the ground.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When attempting our second take-off (with new batteries), the propeller pulled itself off of the shaft.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When attempting our third take-off, the plane… took off. Wait, that’s not a problem, that’s a good thing. Let’s put it in a new section: Flight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video of the flight. It was very bright out and the camera isn’t that great, so it’s very poor quality, but anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were able to fly for a few minutes and collect the key data needed to configure the autopilot. Specifically, we’ll use the typical cruise speed, the amount of throttled used at this speed, and other similar data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the successful flight (and landing), there was one issue while airborne - the RC link to the aircraft was lost for a few seconds at two different points. This is actually a very serious problem since the cause is unknown and if RC is lost for more than a few seconds, the plane will most certainly crash. Here are two plots from after the flight showing the points where the RC link was lost:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altitude and RC Status vs time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EtaE8OgF-
vw/UXIyyG7EHII/AAAAAAAAAEY/eYBPzosEDLE/s1600/RC+Lost+Plot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EtaE8OgF-
vw/UXIyyG7EHII/AAAAAAAAAEY/eYBPzosEDLE/s1600/RC+Lost+Plot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green: Altitude [m] Cyan: RC Status [good (low), poor (middle), lost (high)]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we can see that there were significant altitude drops right after each time the RC link was lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RC Frame rate and RC Status vs time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Dovh1nr6joI/UXI1z
GXcf3I/AAAAAAAAAEg/RZ5ff_bodno/s1600/RC+Framerate+Losses.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Dovh1nr6joI/UXI1zGXcf3I/AAAAAAAAAEg/RZ5ff_bodn
o/s1600/RC+Framerate+Losses.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green: RC Status [good (low), poor (middle), lost (high)] RC Frame Rate [Hz]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we can see that the RC link was indeed weakening - as opposed to it being a hardware failure or software bug in the PPM encoder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re going to have to do some more testing in an attempt to fix this problem. Over the next days and weeks, we’ll be working hard on this and many more issues that are sure to pop up. Despite being busy, we’ll try to keep making posts, especially once we get to competition, so stay tuned!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s back from reading week and into the home stretch of the semester, and we’re gearing up to get to competition readiness! Recently, however, we’ve also been showcasing our work to students, alumni, and the public at various events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We volunteered to host a booth at the fifth annual CO2 Powered Drag Car Races hosted by the Faculty of Engineering. UAARG members covered two tables with posters, our airplane, the ground station and a flight simulator. The flight simulator turned out to be very popular! Even the other clubs wanted to play on the flight simulator! The event took place at West Edmonton mall on Friday, March 15th. At the CO2 races, junior high students raced wooden cars powered by CO2 canisters. Between races, students, parents and teachers visited booths hosted by engineering clubs. The UAARG booth was buzzing with people interested in our avionics box, computer simulator and the competition airplane!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MYrqDbWym5E/UU0v5lWqWWI/AAAAA
AAAAEI/ds3axz9ycK8/s1600/DSC_0472.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MYrqDbWym5E/UU0v5lWqWWI/AAAAAAAAAEI/ds3axz9ycK

&lt;p&gt;UAARG’s Booth at the CO2 Drag Races&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also present for both the Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Mechanical Engineering First-year Nights, where first-year engineering students have the chance to talk to faculty, alumni, and student groups of their engineering field of interest before choosing what program to specialize in for the remainder of their engineering career. Plenty of interested students approached us; they were interested in everything from our plane’s construction to how we each personally got involved with the club to the ever- popular flight simulator. We also brought our plane and poster to the Faculty of Engineering’s Dean’s Reception for alumni. Many alumni took a keen interest in our project; we were asked some challenging questions about our plane’s systems from some very experienced engineers, one of which had worked with UAARG in the past!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the mechanical front this week, we completed our analysis of the center of gravity (CG) of our airframe and its components. As the picture below shows, we have taken the moment of each component measured from the CG of that component to the motor mount wall as a reference point. From this data, we were able to determine the CG of the aircraft which we need to have 32cm to 34cm back from our reference point. If the CG was too far back the airframe would tail heavy and be very likely to stall and enter an unrecoverable dive. If the CG was too far forward the airframe would fly nose heavy, requiring more power to stay in the air and making landing nose down a more prominent issue. The other benefit is that this allows us to track where our weight is distributed and what will have the greatest influence on the CG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Moment=mass*gravity*distance
CG distance=sum of the moments/total mass*gravity
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, we’ve been planning for our upcoming competitions in May and June – the Unmanned Systems Canada UAV competition and the AUVSI Student Unmanned Systems Competition. We have selected the attendees of the competitions and are in the process of figuring out the logistics of travel, boarding, etc.; stay tuned for updates as we approach closer to the competition dates!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>It's Reading Week!!!</title>
      <link>http://uaarg.com/2013/02/18/its-reading-week/</link>

      <guid>http://uaarg.com/2013/02/18/its-reading-week</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s finally reading week!!! A beautiful calm in the center of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been taking this opportunity to make significant progress. We had a work session on Friday and another on Sunday. We’re having a Critical Design Review on Tuesday in addition to our weekly meeting. We’re also volunteering at WISEST on both Tuesday and Wednesday. Sometime near the end of the week we’ll go flying to do some of our first autopilot testing and likely have a pizza and movie night afterwards to celebrate the progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for what’s happened since the last post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air-frame:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve finalized our design for stronger landing gear and have started construction. The only part we have to build is a simple wooden structure which connects the carbon fiber or metal gear to the plane. Hopefully it’ll be done before testing later this week, but if not, then we’ll use the stock landing gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autopilot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots has happened with the autopilot. We got our new PPM encoders in last week and got them up and running with the autopilot right away. We’re still not sure what happened to our old one, but the new ones are working great. For those of you not familiar with it, the PPM encoder takes up to 8 PWM signals from the RC receiver and converts them to a single PPM single which the autopilot can understand. This is necessary to use a modern 2.4 GHz RC transmitter with the Paparazzi system which was designed for older, analog transmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-moLoDd3CH44/USKT2
hkUvrI/AAAAAAAAADg/RahBCTpR-O8/s1600/IMG_20130205_164150.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-moLoDd3CH44/USKT2hkUvrI/AAAAAAAAADg/RahBCTpR-O
8/s1600/IMG_20130205_164150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New PPM Encoders&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also configured Paparazzi to use a switch on the RC controller as a kill switch so that we can bring the plane down even if all we have is the RC link. Previously, we could kill the plane from the ground control station, but if the telemetry link is lost then our only two options are to let the plane try and fly itself home or to take over manual control. If the plane is at the edge of visual range and there are issues with autonomous flight, then neither of these two options are particularly appealing. For those interested in how we did this, take a look at our git repository at &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/uaarg/paparazzi&quot;&gt;github.com/uaarg/paparazzi&lt;/a&gt; . Or for the particular commit, click &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uaarg/paparazzi/commit/2d9048ba2836bc3edd36863ccfe82
a94ae1704ef&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not all we did with the autopilot. We also got our new XTend radios in. These are the radios used to provide the telemetry link between the autopilot and the Ground Control Station. They operate at up to 1 W on the 900 MHz band. Configuring the new radios was simple because we saved our configuration from before. We immediately then went out to test them again. The last time we tested them, we couldn’t get them to work at more than around 100 m. However, we were testing them using a loop-back on the autopilot side. Because of our particular configuration which is optimized for high throughput from the plane to the ground and low, but important, throughput from the ground to the plane, we figured this testing procedure might be part of the problem. So this time, we tested the radios using the autopilot and it’s Ground Control Station. We went out to Quad to see if the radios would work at distances of over 100 m. The image below shows the path the plane was walked through quad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iswfqLX9c5k/USKvk_LNVa
I/AAAAAAAAADw/v6fKTkDbFzs/s1600/Telemetry+Test.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iswfqLX9c5k/USKvk_LNVaI/AAAAAAAAADw/v6fKTkDbFz
s/s1600/Telemetry+Test.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking through Quad with the airplane&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We lost signal after there was no more room to walk without buildings getting in the way. We measured the distance to be 300 m (the yellow line). So it looks like the link is working good. We’ll have to do further testing out in the country to see if it can go 500 m or 1 Km or 4 Km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing we did with the autopilot was figure out a way to configure the on-board radio with it still in the plane, connected to the autopilot. Previously we’ve had to take it out and connect it directly to the computer which has a hassle. Achieving this was surprisingly easy since Paparazzi has code to allow the autopilot board to behave like a USB to serial converter. All we had to do was flash the TWOG with this in the air-frame file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;lt;firmware name=&amp;quot;setup&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;target name=&amp;quot;tunnel&amp;quot; board=&amp;quot;twog_1.0&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;target name=&amp;quot;usb_tunnel_1&amp;quot; board=&amp;quot;twog_1.0&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/firmware&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the computer that’s connected to the TWOG’s USB port can talk to the radio through the TWOG and we can configure the radio without removing it from the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-board Software&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we took a look at the on-board software to try and fix the segmentation faults we’ve been having. With the Panda Board’s UART RX connected to the autopilot’s TX we could how see the telemetry data going from the plane to the ground. However, the segmentation faults continued. We then configured the FTP server properly and tested that the Panda Board could connect to it. Running the on-board code after this worked. So success!!!! We still have work to do to get a fully functional system though. And we want to re-factor the code to allow it to run even when all the parts aren’t connected (camera, autopilot, FTP server, etc…).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past 2 weeks have been relatively quiet, but solid progress towards our goals of flight testing and systems testing in the field are being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing, debugging, and commenting code were done on both the ground station and onboard imaging over the last few weeks with the aim of fixing some persistent bugs and revising code for clarity. This week’s technical demo was of the onboard camera:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheldon is planning to get the camera mounted to the plane as well as connect it to the plane’s power supply in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the airframe front, the foam airplanes for flight testing are complete and ready to fly. The team is continuing to try and find a suitable flying field and time for the foamies. In the meantime, potential pilots are training on the flight simulator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More flight simulator training with the R/C controller&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the completed foamies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also started work on prototyping a new design for the plane’s landing gear mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin puts his carpentry skills to use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design is part of several changes we made to the landing gear to increase overall robustness in the light of several accidents with the landing gear that occurred during competition last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new 2013 UAARG blog! Last Tuesday, we had our first meeting of the new year, in which we discussed work that went on over the holiday break and looked ahead at the final months of work before competition in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached one of our major goals over the holiday season: completing the Competition Paper for the Unmanned Systems Canada Unmanned Air Vehicle Student Competition, the first of our two major competitions this year. This paper is meant to be a document that outlines the design process of the aircraft and describes its major components and systems, from physical construction and flight to communications and imaging. The paper is also judged toward our final score in the competition, so finishing it was a very large milestone, as well as a large relief, for the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major goal reached over the holidays was the completion of the range testing for the communications systems of the aircraft. Several different wireless links are required for both controlled and autonomous flight, as well as transmission of images from the aircraft. The entire system was taken outdoors under conditions similar to those at competition, and the range and capacity of each of the wireless links were tested. Though there are still some problems with communications, the majority of the systems are performing as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some photos from the outdoor range testing, including a graph of successful signal transmission&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still, however, quite a list of items to be completed in the weeks ahead, one of which is flight testing of foam model airplanes so that R/C pilots can be trained for competition. This is a priority at present because of the lack of flight training that the pilots have received so far (flight simulators are fun but no substitute), and we’re going to find an indoor flying field appropriate for this purpose next. We are also working towards having a functional, testable version of the ground station imaging system in a few weeks’ time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few shots of the foam airplanes under construction for pilot training&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stay on track in the meantime, we have set several internal deadlines for the completion and testing of major systems before competition. We are also piloting the idea of short presentations by one of the subgroups (airframe, autopilot, imaging, etc.) at the beginning of each meeting; these are meant to familiarize members with all aspects of the plane and its systems, as well as update on progress in subgroups. Stay tuned for updates on the blog as we gear up for the competition season!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
