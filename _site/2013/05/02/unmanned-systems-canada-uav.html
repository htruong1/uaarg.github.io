            <p>Good news - we have just arrived in Alma, Quebec for the Unmanned Systems
Canada Student UAV Competition. The past few days leading up to competition
have been both hectic and tiring as we struggled to get systems in good
working order, to pack our plane and tools, and to rest up to be in good
traveling shape.</p>

<p>Our plane disassembled and packed in its crate</p>

<p>We met at the airport this morning at 4:30am and promptly discovered that one
and a half hours was not enough to make it to the gate at a comfortable time
for our 6am flight. Re-packing our spare items into checked baggage and
processing our two large oversized crates were both extremely time-consuming,
and we just made it in time for boarding. Fortunately, the remainder of our
trip by air to Montreal went well, and we were able to drop off our crates to
be shipped and promptly get our rental car.</p>

<p>Our crates, finally arrived at Montreal</p>

<p>One of the major things that we got done during the trip was creating a
complete flight plan specific to the airfield in Alma. This included defining
the perimeter of the competition field in our autopilot software, determining
the flight altitude, and creating takeoff and landing waypoints. We also
worked on refining the ground station imaging system and on our Technical
Presentation.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we perform both our Technical Presentation and Flight Readiness
Reviews, both major contributors to our overall score. These are critical for
giving judges an overview of our systems and for ensuring flight safety prior
to the first day of competition flight on Saturday.</p>
