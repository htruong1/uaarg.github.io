            <p>And here we go again…
competition #2: the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International
(AUVSI) Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) competition. This competition
is in Maryland in the US.</p>

<p>Learning from our trip to Quebec, we arrived at the airport 4 hours early this
time. Because of this, and because the airport was practically empty - only
overnight flights were left - baggage check in went smoothly. Our crates were
68 and 70 pounds with the limit being 70. Some of our checked luggage was 48
and 49 pounds, with the limit (to avoid a fee) being 50. We had to show Air
Canada their own rules on maximum luggage size though. Before we did this,
they were telling us the maximum sizes to avoid the oversize fee as if those
were the absolute limits. They were very friendly and helpful though,
especially considering our complex situation.</p>

<p>We’re currently waiting for our flight which should leave at 1:00 am.
Hopefully we’ll get sleep in the air since by the time we get to Washington,
it’ll be 10:00 AM.</p>

<p>As for technical aspects, we’ve been working hard on our system for the past
month and a half. We did lots of flight testing, but damaged the plane twice
and spent a lot of time trying to get neutral IMU values. We’ve fixed our
plane and have relatively reliable stabilized flight, but haven’t achieved
fully autonomous flight yet. As for imaging, we’ve made a lot of progress.
Images are now reliably transferred over FTP and the ground imaging GUI can
load them up as they come in. We still need to work on our geo-referencing
algorithm. Pictures taken during flight testing showed that this can be off by
over 50 meters. We’ll be working on this over the next day or two as well as
enabling telemetry over Wi-Fi so that we can show off our redundant link
software.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to arriving in Maryland (and the comfy beds in our
hotel) as well as the competition itself. Expect a new post around once a day
until the competition is done. Also, feel free to leave comments below, ask
questions, or initiate any other type of discussion. We’d love to hear who’s
reading this blog and are able to post specific content based on what you’re
interested in.</p>
