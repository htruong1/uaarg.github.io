Setting up the UAARG site
=========================
Using the [Jekyll Incorporated](http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/) theme.

Installing dependencies
-----------------------
Assuming you already have Ruby 1.9.3. If not, install it for your system!

You'll also need a javascript runtime. Add this to the Gemfile in this directory:
> gem 'therubyracer'
Then:
> bundle install

Getting started
---------------
Edit _config.yml to enable/disable sharing buttons.

Generating the site
-------------------
> jekyll serve

Publishing the site
-------------------
Github pages doesn't support jekyll plugins, which this site uses. This means that instead of the jekyll source, we have to publish the generated site contents to github pages.
Here's a guide on how to get it set up: http://ixti.net/software/2013/01/28/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html
Basically, you have to set up 2 branches on github:
> git checkout -b source master
> git push -u origin source
Then in the repository settings on github set the *source* branch as default.
Github will publish the site from master and you can version control the site from source.

Once you've got it set up:
> rake publish
publishes the site.
