# UAARG website on Github Pages
This website is using the [Jekyll Incorporated](http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/) theme.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Assuming you already have Ruby 1.9.3. If not, install it for your system!

You'll also need a javascript runtime. Add this to the Gemfile in this directory:
`gem 'therubyracer'`
Then install the required dependencies:
`bundle install`

To serve a local version that you can use for testing:
`jekyll serve --watch`
    
## Configuration
Edit: _config.yml (general options), main.css (theme colors &amp; fonts)

```
uaarg.github.io/
├── _config.yml
├── _assets/
    ├── stylesheets/
        ├── main.scss
```

_Note: when editing _config.yml, you need to restart jekyll to see the changes.__

    
## Publish to Github Pages
There are two branches here: `source` and `master`. Make your site configuration changes, write posts, etc. in the `source` branch; the `master` branch is for the published result!

Once you've made your changes in the `source` branch, you can generate the website with the `rake` task this will modify files in the `_site` directory:
``` 
rake generate
```

To publish the files into the master branch we will first need to make `_site` a git repository pointing to the `master` branch. This can be accomplished with the `rake` task. (This will only need to be done the first time the repository is cloned) 
```
rake setup
```

To push the files onto the master branch you can use the `rake` task.
```
rake push
```

To generate and publish the site you can use the the `rake` task as well. This essentially performs `rake generate` followed by `rake push`.
```
rake publish
```
